# Weather App
This weather app is built using react from vite.js.
to run the web application in local development, clone the git repository, cd WEATHER APP, then npm run dev in vscode terminal or cmd.
instead of index.js, vite utilizes jsx files.
Sass was used for preprocessing css and compiled with the live sass compiler extension.
